Clinic Queue Management Website

This is a class project I developed to demonstrate how technology can streamline the workflow of a small business.

The project focuses on a clinic that offers a variety of aesthetic treatments. The main challenge was that the business owner had difficulty managing appointments manually using paper calendars, which made it hard to keep track of clients and schedules.

My solution is a web application that allows the clinic to manage appointments in a simple and organized way:

Each client has a unique username (letters and numbers).

To log in, the client enters their username and phone number, so the owner can identify who booked the appointment.

After login, the client can browse the available treatments and schedule an appointment by choosing a specific date and time.

The system is accessed through a landing page (frontPage.html), which serves as the entry point of the project. From there, clients can continue to the booking process.

ðŸ‘‰ To run the project from the code folder, simply open frontPage.html in your browser.
